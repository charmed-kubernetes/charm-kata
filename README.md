# Charm for Kata Containers

This subordinate charm deploys the [Kata](https://katacontainers.io/)
untrusted container runtime within a running Juju charm model.  It is
an open source community working to build a secure container runtime with
lightweight virtual machines that feel and perform like containers, but
provide stronger workload isolation using hardware virtualization technology
as a second layer of defense.

This charm is a component of Charmed Kubernetes. For full information,
please visit the [official Charmed Kubernetes docs](https://www.ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs/charm-kata).
